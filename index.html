            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                A Story of Grit<br>

                I am a former U.S. Marine, an experienced professional with exposure to Business Development, Healthcare
                Information Technology Consulting, as well as 10 years of clinical healthcare as a surgical Physician
                Assistant.<br>
                After transitioning from the Marine Corps, I returned to college to complete my Bachelorâ€™s degree. I
                then had a career foray into Business Development with a startup company in the World Trade Center in
                New York City, before eventually turning to healthcare. After initial direct clinical care training as
                an EMT and ER technician in an emergency room in California and then in a prestigious cancer hospital in
                New York City I found my way into Healthcare Information Technology Consulting. This was with a major
                player in the EHR space. This role exposed me to a whole different side of healthcare, client
                relationships, software as a service, and also required significant travel. It was at this point I
                realized I really wanted to be involved in direct clinical healthcare and began the process to prepare
                for graduate school at a Physician Assistant program.
